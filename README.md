Bugs
First bug i had was my hero image wasnt loading, but i manged to change its position, height and width in style.css to fix this
Second bug was my about us list and table not fitting together on the screen or overlapping each other. I fixed this with by adding a class and ID attritbute to both and styled them in css.
Third bug was getting the font awesome icons to work. I fixed this when i found out i hadnt added the font awesome script to the bottom of the page.
Fourth bug was the load time on the hero image being too long. I fixed this as best i can by changing its pixel size and re adding the image.
Fifth bug was the media quieries not aligning with the code i was setting up. I fixed this by re going over the course work and understanding the postions, floats and margins better and implented this in the style.css media queries section.
Un fixed bugs
No unfixed bugs left in the code.
